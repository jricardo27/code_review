                Formatting problems are easy to overlook but they are the most
                common.
                <br>
                Some of them are highlighted by tools like <kbd>pylint</kbd>
                but is not always the case.
                <br>
                These small omissions cause a lot of going back and forth
                wasting the reviewers precious time.

                              is useful because then every line has the same format
                              and adding entries to the end is the same as adding them
                              to the middle.

                              <strong>PEP8</strong> recommend limiting all lines to a maximum of
                              <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id19">79 characters.</a>
                              <br>
                              However there are some projects that raised the limit to 119 characters.
                              <br>
                              My recommendation is to stick to 79 characters even when working on projects with
                              a longer limit and only use the extra limit when breaking the line makes it harder
                              to read.

                        Even though <strong>PEP8</strong> considers <strong>backslashes</strong>
                        appropriate in some cases. They are totally discouraged in this guide.
                        <br>
                        The reason for that is that other alternatives are better and errors could be caused
                        if a space is added after the <strong>backslash</strong>.
