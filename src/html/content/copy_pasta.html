                Copying code is one of the easiest ways to achieve results,
                however at the expense of maintainability.
                <br>
                The moment you find yourself copying code, stop for a moment
                and consider if you can do better and factor out the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following is a list of common scenarios when you duplicate
                code and the most common ways to deal with it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extract it to a base class</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So, you find yourself copying a Django View class
                        (could be any other class) which already implement some
                        useful things (e.g. authentication, permissions, etc)
                        why not extract those useful methods into a
                        <strong>Base Class</strong> or a
                        <strong>Class Mixin</strong>?
                        <br>
                        It's easy:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="align-top">
                                @@include('../include/code/copy_pasta/base_class_bad.py')
                            </td>
                            <td class="align-top">
                                @@include('../include/code/copy_pasta/base_class_good.py')
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Factor out common code</strong>
                    <p>
                        This time you need to perform certain operation,
                        you found out that there is already a
                        method/function that do almost what you need,
                        however it does in <italic>green</italic> not in
                        <italic>blue</italic>, so why not just factor out
                        the code into a tird method/function and pass the
                        color a an argument?
                        <br>
                        It's easy:
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="align-top">
                                @@include('../include/code/copy_pasta/factor_code_bad.py')
                            </td>
                            <td class="align-top">

                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Template includes</strong>
                    <p>
                        Now you have a bunch of templates to do, easy peasy,
                        they are all the same, just the title is different.
                        The above case sounds like the perfect scenario to
                        use the Django template tag <strong>include</strong>:
                    </p>
