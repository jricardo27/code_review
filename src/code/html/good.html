Line 1-2, All code is indented after
    `{{ for }}` making it easier to see what's
    inside and where the block ends.
Lines 2-5, Attributes are aligned and have
    one more extra indentation.
Line 6, Even though uncommon, closing the
    tag on a separate line makes it easier to
    add more attributes.
    It also adds a blank space between the
    tag and it's content.
    It's also OK to close the tag at the end
    of the last attribute (Line 9).
Line 11, A CSS class is used instead of an
    inline style.
